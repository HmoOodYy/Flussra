"""
Period Calculation + Snapshot — the payroll domain's single owner of:

  A. Draft calculated-value refresh policy (_refresh_draft_calculations)
  B. The read-only preview twin of that refresh
     (_compute_draft_line_preview_amounts)
  C. Live authoritative Calculation packet construction
     (_build_live_calculation_packet) and its packet types
     (_CalculationPacketLine, _CalculationPacketDriverTotal,
     _LiveCalculationPacket)
  D. The CP-4B calculation preview API (get_calculation_preview)
  E. Calculation-only source/finalizability validation
     (_validate_period_can_finalize, _validate_legacy_status_canonicalized)
  F. The canonical Active BonusEvent selection used by live Calculation and
     Reporting (_load_active_bonus_events)
  G. Immutable Calculation snapshot capture (_capture_calculation_snapshot)
     and its report evidence / hash-projection helpers
     (_load_report_evidence, _packet_driver_totals_for_hash)

Extracted from app.payroll.service (Stage B4-17) as a dependency-closed leaf
module — no behavior change, pure relocation. A fresh B4-17 discovery proved
the transitive service.py-local closure of these 14 symbols is empty: this
module depends only on already-extracted true owners (app.payroll.eligibility,
app.payroll.guards, app.payroll.draft_line_calculation,
app.payroll.line_type_vocabulary, app.payroll.period_read,
app.payroll.schemas, app.payroll.snapshot_hash,
app.payroll.status_payment_sync, app.payroll.immutable_evidence,
app.payroll.calculation.per_unit, app.core.service) and never imports
app.payroll.service.

This module is intentionally NOT split into separate live/snapshot modules:
_LiveCalculationPacket is the direct input contract to snapshot capture, the
three packet types are shared by live construction, hash projection and
capture, _refresh_draft_calculations/_compute_draft_line_preview_amounts are
an intentional write/read policy pair that must not drift apart, and
Lifecycle (still in app.payroll.service) invokes build-then-capture as one
transactionally-coherent operation.

Distinct from app.payroll.calculation (the CP-4A pure PerUnit calculation
core, per_unit.py only) — that package is intentionally the pure
calculation-core namespace; this module is the DB-heavy period-level
orchestration that consumes it.

`_validate_period_can_finalize` lives here despite its name and its
"Phase 7: Shared finalization validator" banner (preserved unchanged below):
fresh discovery proved its only production caller is
_build_live_calculation_packet, and neither finalize_period nor
get_finalization_preview call it. Its banner's claim of being "used by both"
is pre-existing documentation drift from an earlier snapshot-based
finalization rework and is relocated as-is, not corrected, per this stage's
structural-extraction-only scope.

Transaction ownership is above this module. Every function here receives an
ambient AsyncConnection and opens no transaction, commits nothing, and rolls
back nothing. _capture_calculation_snapshot assumes its caller (Lifecycle)
already owns the period/workflow locks and is intentionally non-idempotent —
each call inserts a new immutable snapshot row set; repeat-call protection is
the caller's responsibility.

Preview is read-only by construction: get_calculation_preview ->
_build_live_calculation_packet -> _compute_draft_line_preview_amounts emits
no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. Only _refresh_draft_calculations (Lifecycle-invoked,
never Calculation-preview-invoked) mutates payroll.payrolldraftlines.

Finalization (finalize_period, get_finalization_preview, and their approved-
snapshot helpers) and Lifecycle (change_period_status, resubmit_period, and
their transaction/audit helpers) remain in app.payroll.service — both are
proven dependency-disjoint from this module. Lifecycle still resolves
_refresh_draft_calculations, _build_live_calculation_packet, and
_capture_calculation_snapshot as plain imported bindings in service.py's
namespace; those three bindings are load-bearing there, not merely test
compatibility.

    CP-4D completeness guard: reject Submit/Resubmit if a legacy DailyStatus
    DraftLine exists for a driver/day with no corresponding live-selected
    canonical PayrollPeriodDriverDayEntryState row.

    `_load_report_evidence` (the CP-4D immutable Status-evidence reader) reads
    only canonical entry-state rows with a non-voided StatusKeyID -- it never
    falls back to DraftLines. Without this guard, such a day would silently
    capture zero Status evidence while the snapshot still reports a versioned,
    "complete" ReportEvidenceVersion.

    A canonical row that exists but only carries NoteText (StatusKeyID NULL --
    e.g. a note-only save on an old period whose legacy Status code was never
    re-entered) does not satisfy this check; the legacy Status is still
    unrepresented. DailyNote-only legacy lines are out of scope: NoteText is
    never part of the immutable Status evidence contract (`_load_report_evidence`
    requires `StatusKeyID IS NOT NULL`), so a missing canonical row can never
    cause a note to disappear from that evidence.

    Read-only. Returns a blocker list (empty = no gap found).

    Read-only, live provisional expected-income breakdown for an Open or
    Returned period, calculated from CURRENT effective source/config data.

    Distinct from `get_finalization_preview` above (Approved-only, mirrors
    exactly what `finalize_period` will write): this is a live preview for
    the two lifecycle statuses that still allow correction/entry. It is
    never a submitted snapshot -- InReview/Approved/Locked/Archived/
    Cancelled all remain out of scope (see the CP-4C+ future snapshot
    contract for those).

    Absolute read-only guarantee: no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, no audit write,
    no period/source/derived-state mutation of any kind. Does not call
    `_refresh_draft_calculations`, `_sync_status_payment_for_entry_state`,
    `_refresh_status_payment_lines`, or `finalize_period`.

    Reuses, unchanged:
      - `_compute_draft_line_preview_amounts` -> `_compute_calculated_amount`
        -> CP-4A's `calculate_per_unit` for daily PerUnit lines (and the
        existing EnteredAmount/Fixed/None/manual dispatch for the rest);
      - the canonical PayrollBonusEvents Active-only read;
      - the CP-3C minimum/maximum-then-bonus ordering.

    Adds, new to CP-4B:
      - `_resolve_live_status_payment_lines`, which reads the canonical
        `PayrollPeriodDriverDayEntryState.StatusKeyID` selection directly
        and resolves the CURRENT applicable DriverRate live -- the stored
        STATUS_PAYMENT/STATUS_PAY compatibility-projection DraftLine is
        excluded from the stored-line aggregation below and is never used
        as live truth, so a stale projection can never be double-counted.

    Driver inclusion is financial-source-driven only (a driver with a
    current daily line, a canonical selected Status, a non-BONUS period-pay
    line, or an Active bonus event) -- not a full eligible-driver roster.
