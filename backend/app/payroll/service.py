# to app.payroll.draft_line_calculation, which now imports all four rate
# helpers directly from app.payroll.rates; this module no longer needs any

# shared by domains that all still live in this module — Draft-line CRUD,
# Bonus, and Day Grid — none of which is more entitled to
# own either helper than the others. Stage B4-12 moved Period Pay Lines out
# of this module; it now imports both directly from their true-owner modules.

# its only purpose is constructing _LEGACY_TO_CANONICAL, which now happens

# legacy constants that construct _LineTypeInfo instances,
# _SYSTEM_LINE_TYPE_INFO and _SYSTEM_LINE_TYPES, deliberately stay in this
# module unchanged (B4-10 Decision Review): _SYSTEM_LINE_TYPES has zero real
# callers anywhere and _SYSTEM_LINE_TYPE_INFO is referenced only by that dead
# set, so neither is genuinely shared vocabulary — they are legacy residue
# left for a future dedicated dead-code cleanup stage, not this one. They
# continue to resolve _LineTypeInfo via this import at module-import time.

# Pay Lines (add_period_pay_line, update_period_pay_line) out of this module;
# it now imports this helper directly from app.payroll.pay_item_write_lock.
# Stage B4-14 moved Draft-line CRUD (add_draft_line, update_draft_line) out
# of this module too; it now imports this helper directly from the same
# owner module. The five concurrency tests in test_cp0a_mutation_status_guard.py
# and test_cp0d_concurrency_regression.py that used to patch
# service._lock_pay_item_for_source_write / service._lock_period_for_mutation
# to intercept those two callers were retargeted to patch
# app.payroll.draft_line_mutation directly, where the moved functions now
# resolve those names. Stage B4-16 moved Day Grid (save_day_grid) out of
# this module — that was the last remaining caller of
# _lock_pay_item_for_source_write here, and no test patches it through this
# module's namespace (all of them target app.payroll.draft_line_mutation),
# so the binding is NOT re-exported anymore. Day Grid owns its own import
# and, with it, the unchanged pay-item-then-period lock ordering, which is
# enforced by each caller rather than by the function itself.
# Stage B4-11C: the shared source-line read model (_LINE_SELECT,
# _line_row_to_summary, _get_line_by_id) moved to
# app.payroll.source_line_read in full. Stage B4-12 moved Period Pay Lines
# out of this module; it now imports all three directly from
# app.payroll.source_line_read. Stage B4-14 moved Draft-line CRUD (which
# called _get_line_by_id) out of this module too, and it now imports its own
# copy directly from the same owner module — _get_line_by_id has no
# remaining caller here and is NOT re-exported. _LINE_SELECT and
# _line_row_to_summary keep a plain imported binding here: get_period_lines
# still lives in this module and still calls both by their bare names — this

# Stage B4-11D: the SOURCE-domain audit-evidence adapter
# (_capture_source_evidence) moved to app.payroll.source_evidence in full.
# Stage B4-12 moved Period Pay Lines out of this module; it now imports this
# helper directly from app.payroll.source_evidence. Stage B4-14 moved
# Draft-line CRUD (add_draft_line, update_draft_line, void_draft_line) out of
# this module too — those were the only remaining callers of
# _capture_source_evidence here (Day Grid never called it directly). It now
# imports its own copy directly from app.payroll.source_evidence, and this
# binding is NOT re-exported: no caller in this module resolves the bare
# name anymore. Not folded into app.payroll.audit_evidence: that module is
# deliberately generic infrastructure, and source_evidence.py is the SOURCE
# domain's own adapter over it (dependency direction: source_evidence.py ->
# audit_evidence.py, never the reverse, and never -> app.payroll.service).
# Stage B4-11E: the period pay-item snapshot read accessors
# (_period_has_pay_item_snapshot, _get_period_pay_item_snapshot) moved to
# app.payroll.period_pay_item_snapshot in full. Stage B4-12 moved Period Pay
# Lines out of this module; it now imports both directly from
# app.payroll.period_pay_item_snapshot. Stage B4-16 moved Day Grid
# (get_day_grid, save_day_grid) out of this module — those were the last
# remaining callers of either accessor here, so neither is re-exported
# anymore; Day Grid imports its own copies directly. Not placed under
# app.payroll.period_creation: see the historical B4-4A note at the
# "Work-date accessor" banner below.
# Stage B4-13A: the canonical Day Entry State domain (_validate_status_key,
# _resolve_status_key_id, _upsert_entry_state, _void_entry_state_field,
# _enforce_status_key_limits) moved to app.payroll.day_entry_state in full.
# _KEEP is NOT re-exported: it has zero real executable consumers anywhere
# in the repo (confirmed by a fresh whole-repo search at this stage) and was
# left behind in this module as legacy/dead residue rather than promoted
# into the new module without a live consumer. _canonical_aliases and
# _parse_quantity were evaluated and deliberately NOT moved: both are
# save_day_grid-only input-normalization helpers with zero coupling to the
# entry-state table, no StatusKey involvement, and no audit evidence of
# their own — they stay Day-Grid-owned, defined locally below, pending a
# future Day Grid ownership stage. Stage B4-14 moved Draft-line CRUD
# (add_draft_line, update_draft_line, void_draft_line) out of this module —
# those were the only remaining callers of _resolve_status_key_id and
# _void_entry_state_field here, so neither is re-exported anymore; Draft CRUD

# Stage B4-16 moved Day Grid (save_day_grid) out of this module — that was
# the last remaining caller of _upsert_entry_state, _validate_status_key and
# _enforce_status_key_limits here, so none of the three is re-exported
# anymore; Day Grid imports its own copies directly. _canonical_aliases and
# _parse_quantity moved with it into app.payroll.day_grid, where the B4-13A
# ownership finding above (save_day_grid-only input normalization, no
# entry-state coupling) still holds.
# Stage B4-13B: the shared period-day calendar validator
# (_validate_period_work_date) moved to app.payroll.period_day_calendar in
# full. Not placed under app.payroll.period_creation: see the historical
# B4-4A note carried into the new module's own docstring. app.payroll.off_drivers
# no longer resolves this helper through this module's facade — it now
# imports it directly from app.payroll.period_day_calendar. Stage B4-14
# moved Draft-line CRUD (add_draft_line) out of this module — it now imports
# its own copy directly from app.payroll.period_day_calendar. Stage B4-16
# moved Day Grid (get_day_grid, save_day_grid) out of this module — those
# were the last remaining callers here, so this binding is NOT re-exported
# anymore; Day Grid imports its own copy directly.
# Stage B4-13C: the Draft-line calculation kernel (_CalcResult,
# _compute_calculated_amount) moved to app.payroll.draft_line_calculation in
# full. _CalcResult is NOT re-exported: every caller only accesses the
# returned instance's attributes (e.g. .calculated_amount), never the class
# name itself — confirmed by a fresh whole-module search at that stage — so
# no binding is load-bearing for it. Stage B4-14 moved Draft-line CRUD
# (add_draft_line, update_draft_line) out of this module — it now imports
# its own copy of _compute_calculated_amount directly from
# app.payroll.draft_line_calculation. Stage B4-17 moved
# _refresh_draft_calculations and _compute_draft_line_preview_amounts (the
# last two remaining PRODUCTION callers here) to app.payroll.period_calculation,
# which imports its own copy directly. This binding stays here, though, as
# test-only compatibility: test_cp4a_perunit_core.py and
# test_phase4_characterization_slice1.py both import
# _compute_calculated_amount directly from app.payroll.service.

# _validate_line_type / _SYSTEM_FINALIZATION_ONLY / _CALC_REQUIRED_BEHAVIORS
# policy) moved to app.payroll.draft_line_mutation in full. Only the three
# public mutation functions keep a plain imported binding here: save_day_grid
# still lives in this module and still calls all three by their bare names
# (void_draft_line for zeroed lines, add_draft_line for new lines,
# update_draft_line for quantity changes) — this binding is load-bearing for
# that runtime caller, not incidental, and stays until Day Grid itself
# moves. The read surfaces (get_period_lines, get_period_draft_summary) are
# NOT part of this domain and were not moved — "CRUD" here is mutation-only.
# _validate_line_type, _SYSTEM_FINALIZATION_ONLY, and _CALC_REQUIRED_BEHAVIORS
# are NOT re-exported: a fresh whole-module search at this stage confirmed
# zero remaining caller of any of the three in this module.
# Stage B4-16 moved Day Grid (save_day_grid) out of this module — that was

# _calculate_status_payment_amount, _sync_status_payment_for_entry_state,
# _LiveStatusLine, _resolve_live_status_payment_lines,
# _refresh_status_payment_lines) moved to app.payroll.status_payment_sync in
# full. Four keep a plain imported binding here: Day Grid (save_day_grid)
# still calls _sync_status_payment_for_entry_state, Lifecycle
# (change_period_status, resubmit_period) still calls
# _refresh_status_payment_lines, and Calculation
# (_build_live_calculation_packet) still calls
# _resolve_live_status_payment_lines and references
# _STATUS_PAYMENT_PROJECTION_SQL by its bare name — all still live in this
# module in this unit, so these four bindings are load-bearing, not
# incidental. _calculate_status_payment_amount and _LiveStatusLine are NOT
# re-exported: a fresh whole-module search at this stage confirmed both are
# referenced only internally within the moved cluster itself (the latter's
# class name is never referenced by its one remaining caller, which only
# accesses the returned instances' attributes) — no binding is load-bearing
# for either.
# Stage B4-16 moved Day Grid (save_day_grid) out of this module — that was

# back to the hardcoded _SYSTEM_LINE_TYPE_INFO value ONLY as a backward-compat
# measure during zero-downtime deploys.  On a properly migrated DB (head >= 0008)
