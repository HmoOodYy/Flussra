"""
Source-line read model — shared row-level projection over
payroll.payrolldraftlines.

Extracted from app.payroll.service (Stage B4-11C) as a dependency-closed leaf
module — no behavior change, pure relocation.

Draft CRUD and Period Pay both store their source rows in
payroll.payrolldraftlines, with WorkDate NULL distinguishing Period Pay rows
from daily source rows. These three symbols are the common row-level
read/projection contract over that table: _LINE_SELECT is the canonical
SELECT/projection SQL, _line_row_to_summary maps a row to a DraftLineSummary,
and _get_line_by_id is the shared lookup by draft-line id + company id using
the same projection.

This is a read-model responsibility only — it is neutral between Draft CRUD
and Period Pay, and contains no source-write locking, source-evidence/audit,
mutation-locking, or daily-vs-period-pay policy. Daily-vs-period semantics
(WorkDate filtering, allowed behaviors, validation) remain the responsibility
of each caller's own WHERE clauses and validation, not this module.

Genuinely shared by Draft-line CRUD (app.payroll.draft_line_mutation) and
Period Pay (app.payroll.period_pay) — none of which is more entitled to own
it than the others.

Stage B4-21 moved get_period_lines and get_period_draft_summary here from
app.payroll.service — pure relocation, no behavior change. get_period_lines
is the third consumer of _LINE_SELECT/_line_row_to_summary (now local calls
rather than an imported facade binding). get_period_draft_summary uses its
own direct aggregate SQL, unrelated to _LINE_SELECT, and is not merged with
Day Grid or Ledger read logic.
